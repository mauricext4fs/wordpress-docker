# wordpress-docker

Set of utility to setup wordpress in docker with proxy pass for separated backend api

See USAGE.md for installation guide.

## MySQL

This bundle does not include a MySQL server. Our desired is to keep the system as 
simple as possible.

As this is intended for any type of user with only basic Terminal skills, we decided that 
it was more appropriate to let the user setup his database separetly. Consequently, 
the user does not need to learn about data persistency, volumes and other important 
technical details that involved running the database localy in docker.


## Setup

See USAGE.md
